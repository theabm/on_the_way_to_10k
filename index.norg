* On the way to 10k 
  This is my own personal growth project. 
  Legend says that if you put 10,000 hours on a specific topic, you will become 
  a master in it. 
  Therefore, the aim of this project is to put those 10,000 hours on the various 
  tools I will find along my journey. The topics may not necessarily be cohesive 
  in the traditional sense. For example, the material may include new programming 
  languages, better tools for sofware developing, ideas workflow management, 
  as well as advanced themes in areas I already posses some versatility in. However,
  they all coexist under the paradigm of self improvement. 
  The ultimate goal is to document my learning journey as I attempt at becoming a 
  master version of myself, as well as make these tools available for anyone
  in a similar path.
