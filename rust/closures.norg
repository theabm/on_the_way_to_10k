Closures 

______

Closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as 
arguments to other functions. You can create the closure in one place and then 
call the closure elsewhere to evaluate it in a different context. Unlike 
functions, closures can capture values from the scope in which theyâ€™re defined.
