* What is Dash?

  Dash is a a framework for building web interactive web applications for 
  visualization.

* Main building blocks of Dash

  Dash relies on three foundational concepts that interact with one another 
  to produce an interactive web app.
** Dash Components
   These are all the things we observe and interact with in the web app. 
   Some examples are:
   - Drop-down menus
   - Sliders
   - Titles
   - Figures

   And so on. 

   Basically, anything that is visible, is a component in our app.
** Dash Layout

   The dash layout determines the look and feel of the application as well as 
   how the components will be placed in the window of visualization. 

   It acts as a sort of container for all our components and also enables us to 
   specify some additional aspects, such as themes, margins, etc.
** Dash Call Back

   The Call Back functionality in Dash is the foundational concept that enables 
   interaction of any sort. 

   Without this aspect, the app would be completely static. 

* Hello World Of Dash

  Below we show how to start a very basic Dash application. 

  #tangle app1.py
  @code python 
    from dash import Dash, dcc
    import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc

    # Instantiate your app 
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])

    # Build your components
    hello_world = dcc.Markdown(children="# Hello World !")

    # Customize your own Layout
    app.layout = dbc.Container([hello_world])

    # Run the app on port 8000
    if __name__=='__main__':
        app.run_server(port=8000)
  @end

  In the above example, we use the dash bootstrap components. This is an extenal 
  library that enables extremely easy and intuitive customization if youre not 
  familiar with html.

  To run this example, it is important to ensure that dash and 
  dash_bootstrap_components are installed in your system. Both can be installed 
  via `pip`.

  Finally, a last important note, is that to use the dash bootstrap components, 
  one *must* use a bootstrap theme in the instantiation of the app. Otherwise 
  an error will occur.

* Dash Components

  We now discuss some dash components in more detail.

  As we saw before, these can be accessed using the following module:

  @code python
  from dash import dcc
  @end

** The Dropdown Menu

   Dropdown menus are a very common aspect of Dash apps, as they enable 
   a user to select among a few options which in turn change the visualization 
   present. 

   The syntax is as follows:
   @code python
   from dash import Dash, dcc
   import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc

   # Instantiate your app 
   app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.DARKLY])

   my_dropdown = dcc.Dropdown(

       # The id allows me to later specify this component in the callback.
       # Therefore, I dont necessarily need to create a variable.
       # For sake of simplicity, we do it.
       id="goal_position",

       # The options of my dropdown menu

       # Options can be declared in various ways.

       # Way 1: As a list

       # options = ["New York", "San Francisco", "Los Angeles"]

       # In this way, we are simply using a list where the value
       # and label are the same. 

       # Way 2: As a dictionary

       # options = {
       #   "NY": "New York",
       #   "SF": "San Francisco",
       #   "LA": "Los Angeles"
       # }

       # In this way, we have a dictionary, where the keys are the labels 
       # we see in the dropdown, while the values are the values we use 
       # internally.
       # However, in this way, the ordering of the keys is random.

       # Way 3: As a list of dictionaries

       options=[
           # Disabling makes that option not available for selection
           {"label": "NY", "value": "New York", "disabled": False},
           {"label": "SF", "value": "San Francisco"},
           {"label": "LA", "value": "Los Angeles"},
       ],

       # In this way, we are ensuring the ordering is exactly as we specify it.

       # We now can set other attributes:

       # The value attribute is the initial value that the dropdown will have 
       # upon startup of the app.
       value="New York",

       # The multi keyword specifies if multiple values can be selected at once.
       multi=False,

       # The clearable attribute specifies whether the dropdown can be empty 
       # at any given time.

       clearable=False,

       # The searchable attribute specifies whether the user can search within 
       # the dropdown. This is especially useful when the drop down is very big.

       searchable=True,

       # The placeholder attribute specifies what text the user sees when the menu 
       # is empty, e.g. "Select a city..."

       # placeholder="Select a city"

       # The persistence_type attribute specifies the length of time that the 
       # menu will remember a users choice.
       # It can be: 'local', 'session' or 'memory'
       # local: reset on page refresh
       # session: reset after browser quits
       # memory: data is kept even after browser quits
       persistence_type="local",
   )

   app.layout = dbc.Container([my_dropdown])

    # Run the app on port 8000
    if __name__=='__main__':
        app.run_server(port=8000)
   @end

   Note that options accepts many other types, such as numpy and pandas arrays, 
   as well as other dash components. More info can be found

** The Slider

   The slider is another popular feature of Dash as it features a slider which 
   can be moved to set some options.

   @code python
    from dash import Dash, dcc
    import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc

    external_stylesheets = ['https://codepen.io/chriddyp/pen/bWLwgP.css']

    # Instantiate your app 
    app = Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.DARKLY])

    my_slider = dcc.Slider(
        id='my-slider',
        # The minimum value of the slider
        min=0,
        # The maximum value of the slider
        max=20,
        # The steps that the slider takes (this determines the values)
        step=5,
        # The initial value of the slider
        value=10,
    ),

    app.layout = dbc.Container([my_slider])

    # Run the app on port 8000
    if __name__=='__main__':
        app.run_server(port=8000)
   @end

   As we can see, the slider works very similarly to the `range` function in 
   python.
