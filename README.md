# On the way to 10k 

  This is my own personal growth project. 

  Legend says that if you put 10,000 hours on a specific topic, 
  you will become a master in it. 

  Therefore, the aim of this project is to put those 10,000 hours on 
  the various tools I will find along my journey. The topics may not 
  be cohesive in any sense as I try to document all the things I find 
  interesting.

  For example, the material may include new programming 
  languages, better tools for sofware developing, ideas for workflow 
  management, as well as more in depth analysis in areas I already 
  posses some versatility in. 

  However, they all coexist under the paradigm of self-improvement. 
  The ultimate goal is to document my learning journey as I attempt 
  at becoming a better version of myself, while also making these 
  tools available for anyone in a similar path.

  At the moment, all the material consists of notes that I take for myself 
  using Neorg, which explains the strange syntax if you are viewing the 
  content in its raw format.
