# Git and Github Guide

## Intro

Git is one of the most common frameworks for version control. It keeps track of
all the changes we make in a project so that we can easily add new features, and 
revert back to working copies in case our code breaks. 

Github is one of the most popular hosting platforms where you can store your git 
projects - also known as `repositories`. Therefore, if anything were to happen to 
your local copy, a backup is always found online. Github also enables collaborations
among different parties, facilitating tremendously open source.
